You will learn by doing. You will have to implement some code following the comments in these files:

We have built some tests to check that you implement it correctly. To get started first run:
  
  `npm run test-koans-1`
  
Then implement the tasks following the comments in koans-1/tasks/* . When it passes all the tests then do the same with `npm run test-koans-2`and koans-2/tasks/*
